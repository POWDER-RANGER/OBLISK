# OBLISK

Multi-agent AI system with encrypted vaults, governance, and symbolic planning

## Overview

OBLISK is an advanced multi-agent artificial intelligence system designed to enable secure, collaborative AI agents with built-in governance mechanisms and symbolic reasoning capabilities. The platform combines encrypted data vaults, agent coordination, and sophisticated planning systems to create a robust framework for autonomous AI operations.

## Project Goals

- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Enable multiple AI agents to work together efficiently while maintaining individual autonomy
- **Encrypted Vaults**: Provide secure, encrypted storage for sensitive data and agent state information
- **Governance Framework**: Implement transparent and auditable governance mechanisms for agent behavior and decision-making
- **Symbolic Planning**: Utilize symbolic AI techniques for complex reasoning and long-term planning
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling to support large-scale agent deployments
- **Interoperability**: Enable agents to communicate and coordinate across different platforms and protocols

## Features

### Core Features
- **Agent Management**: Create, configure, and monitor multiple AI agents
- **Vault System**: Secure encrypted storage with fine-grained access control
- **Governance Engine**: Policy-based decision making and audit trails
- **Symbolic Planner**: Advanced planning capabilities using symbolic reasoning
- **Communication Layer**: Robust inter-agent communication protocols
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Real-time insights into agent behavior and system performance

### Security Features
- End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data
- Zero-knowledge architecture for vault access
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all operations
- Tamper-proof governance records

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Agent Framework**: Custom multi-agent orchestration layer
- **Encryption**: AES-256, RSA-4096, libsodium
- **Symbolic Planning**: PDDL-based planner with custom extensions
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL (metadata), distributed file storage (vaults)
- **Communication**: gRPC, WebSocket
- **Governance**: Blockchain-based audit trail (optional)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Testing**: pytest, hypothesis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 6+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/POWDER-RANGER/OBLISK.git
cd OBLISK

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up configuration
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your settings

# Initialize database
python -m oblisk.core.db init

# Run the system
python -m oblisk.main
```

## Usage

### Creating an Agent

```python
from oblisk.agents import Agent
from oblisk.vault import Vault

# Create a new agent
agent = Agent(
    name="research_assistant",
    capabilities=["research", "analysis", "reporting"],
    vault=Vault.create(encrypted=True)
)

# Start the agent
agent.start()
```

### Working with Vaults

```python
from oblisk.vault import Vault

# Create encrypted vault
vault = Vault.create(
    name="sensitive_data",
    encryption_key=your_key,
    access_policy=access_policy
)

# Store data
vault.store("api_key", secret_value)

# Retrieve data
value = vault.retrieve("api_key")
```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```
