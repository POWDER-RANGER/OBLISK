## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 6+
- Git

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OBLISK.git
   cd OBLISK
   ```

2. **Add upstream remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/POWDER-RANGER/OBLISK.git
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install development dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

5. **Set up pre-commit hooks:**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install

6. **Configure the project:**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   # Edit config.yaml with your local settings
   ```

7. **Initialize the database:**
   ```bash
   python -m oblisk.core.db init
   ```

8. **Run tests to verify setup:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

Follow these conventions for clear and consistent commit history:

- **Use the present tense** ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- **Use the imperative mood** ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- **Limit the first line to 72 characters or less**
- **Reference issues and pull requests** after the first line
- **Use conventional commit format when applicable:**
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `style:` for formatting changes
  - `refactor:` for code refactoring
  - `test:` for test additions or modifications
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

**Example:**
```
feat: add multi-agent coordination protocol

Implements the basic framework for agents to communicate
and coordinate tasks through the messaging layer.

Resolves #123
```

### Python Style Guide

- **Follow PEP 8** with modifications per `.flake8` config
- **Use Black** for code formatting (line length: 88)
- **Use type hints** for all functions and methods
- **Write docstrings** in Google style format
- **Keep functions focused** - one function, one responsibility
- **Use meaningful variable names** - clarity over brevity

**Example:**

```python
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any

def create_agent(
    name: str,
    capabilities: list[str],
    config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> Agent:
    """Create a new agent with the specified capabilities.
    
    Args:
        name: Unique identifier for the agent
        capabilities: List of capability strings
        config: Optional configuration dictionary
        
    Returns:
        Configured Agent instance
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If name is empty or capabilities list is invalid
    """
    if not name:
        raise ValueError("Agent name cannot be empty")
    
    return Agent(name=name, capabilities=capabilities, config=config or {})
```

### Documentation Style Guide

- **Use Markdown** for all documentation
- **Keep lines under 100 characters** for readability
- **Include code examples** for API documentation
- **Provide context** - explain the "why" not just the "what"
- **Use proper grammar and spelling**
- **Update relevant docs** when making code changes

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use fixtures for common test setup
- Mock external dependencies

**Example:**

```python
import pytest
from oblisk.agents import Agent

@pytest.fixture
def sample_agent():
    """Fixture providing a basic test agent."""
    return Agent(
        name="test_agent",
        capabilities=["test"],
    )

def test_agent_starts_successfully(sample_agent):
    """Test that an agent can be started without errors."""
    # Arrange
    assert sample_agent.state == "initialized"
    
    # Act
    sample_agent.start()
    
    # Assert
    assert sample_agent.state == "running"
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_agents.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=oblisk tests/

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v tests/
```

## Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (tests, linting, type checking)
2. **Code review** by at least one maintainer
3. **Documentation review** if docs are changed
4. **Final approval** and merge by project maintainer
